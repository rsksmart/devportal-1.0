After fulfilling the steps *Pre-requisites*, *Get the source code*, *Ensure the security chain* and *Get external dependencies* according to your operating system ([Windows](/rsk/node/contribute/windows), [Linux](/rsk/node/contribute/linux), [Mac](/rsk/node/contribute/macos)), you can compile and run an RSK node from command line following these steps.

## Compiling and running the node

From the root directory where the code was downloaded, execute:

`./gradlew build -x test`

After building, run:

`java -cp [jar] co.rsk.Start`
