RSK is the Smart Contract platform of Bitcoin. Its engine is a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), and the RVM (RSK Virtual Machine) is compatible with Ethereum [Smart Contracts](/develop) and the [tools](/tools) used to [deploy and interact](/tutorials/) with them.

The [Smart Bitcoin (RBTC)](/rsk/rbtc) is the native currency in RSK and it is used to pay for the gas required for the execution of transactions. It is pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin, which means in RSK there are exactly 21M RBTC. A [Powpeg](/rsk/architecture/powpeg/) allows the [transfer of bitcoins](/rsk/rbtc/conversion) from the Bitcoin blockchain to the RSK blockchain and vice-versa.

To learn more about RSK architecture, please refer to the [Original](https://www.rsk.co/Whitepapers/RSK_White_Paper-ORIGINAL.pdf) or [Updated](https://www.rsk.co/Whitepapers/RSK-White-Paper-Updated.pdf) RSK whitepapers.

RSK has two networks, one is a development or testing network (also known as Testnet), and the other a production network (Mainnet), with blocks every 30 seconds.

To interact with the network, you need access to a node. The following are the available options:
- [Use public nodes](/rsk/public-nodes)
- [Install node](/rsk/node/install)
- [Compile the node code](/rsk/node/contribute/)
- [Powpeg HSM Firmware Attestation](/rsk/architecture/powpeg#powpeg-hsm-firmware-attestation)
