Here you have the steps to compile and run an RSK node on Linux.

This page is organized in this way:

- [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
- [Get the source code](#get-the-source-code)
- [Ensure the security chain](#ensure-the-security-chain)
- [Get external dependencies](#get-external-dependencies)
- [Compiling the node](#compiling-the-node)
- [IDEA Build/Run configuration](#idea-buildrun-configuration)
- [Running the node](#running-the-node)

## Pre-requisites

First of all, you will need to install:

|Dependency        | Details|
|------------- |-------------|
|[Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)| Download this Git command line tool|
|[Java 8 JDK](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html) | Follow the steps to install Java. To check if installation went correctly, check the version with command: `java-version`. Then, as admin, modify `/etc/enviroment` adding `JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle"`|
|[IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux)| Install this Java IDE |

## Get the source code

Using the installed command-line tool Git, you need to retrieve (or clone) the RskJ Github source code from [here](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj).

Run these commands on Git command line:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj.git
cd rskj
git checkout tags/PAPYRUS-2.2.0 -b PAPYRUS-2.2.0
```

*Note:* It is better to download the code into a short path.

## Ensure the security chain

[Ensure the security chain](/rsk/node/security-chain) of the downloaded source code.

## Get external dependencies

Before you can launch IntelliJ IDEA, there is an important step.
Browse in your RskJ cloned directory and then launch `configure.sh` with the following terminal command:

```shell
./configure.sh
```

This will download and set important components (e.g. Gradle Wrapper).

## Compiling the node

Now, you can launch IntelliJ IDEA:

In a terminal, and from the folder you extracted the `tar.gz`, go into `idea/bin/`.
Then, type the following command to load the script:

```shell
./idea/sh
```

When IntelliJ IDEA is launched you should have a window with different choices.

- Choose *Import project*.
- Browse in the RskJ downloaded code the file `rskj\build.gradle` and select it. Click *NEXT*.
- Within the dialog select *Use default gradle wrapper* and then click *Finish*.
*Keep IntelliJ IDEA open*.

### IDEA Build/Run configuration

We need to create a new configuration profile to run the node from IDEA.
That can be done by clicking on *Run* -> *Edit Configurations* or as shown in the following picture:

Then set the options as shown below:

![img](/assets/img/rsk/howToInstallAndRun/AddNewConfig.png)

- Main Class: `co.rsk.Start`
- Working directory: `/path-to-code/rskJ`
- Use classpath of module: `rskj-core_main`
- JRE need to be set as: `Default (1.8 - SDK of 'rsk-core_main' module)`

### Running the node

We are ready to run the node using IDEA, just press the *Start* (green arrow) button at the right of the configuration we've just created.

If everything is OK you should see the debug information like that:

And yes! Congratulations! Now you're running a local RSK node :)

You're joined to Mainnet by default.

If you want to switch the network, add:

- For Testnet: `--testnet`
- For Regtest: `--regtest`

Inside the field `Program Arguments` in your run configuration.
