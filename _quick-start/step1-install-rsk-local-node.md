## Step 1 : Install RSK local node

RSK node can be installed on all major platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac. 
Originally named in Bitcoin, local node is know as RegTest node.

In this tutorial, we provide step-by-step instructions for running a local RegTest node through Docker. Docker installation supports Mac, Windows, and Linux.

### Prepare the Environment

The tutorial project files can be downloaded from this [github repo](https://github.com/rsksmart/truffle-integration).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/truffle-integration
cd truffle-integration
```

For Mac OSX Developers:

Please ensure you are running xcode directly and not the command-line instance. Run

```shell
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

### Install Docker Desktop Client

Docker Desktop provides an easy and fast way for running containerized applications on various of operating systems.

For Mac OSX and Windows:

- [Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install
- Start the Docker Desktop client
- Login with a Docker Hub free account

For Linux:

- Install [Docker Engine Community](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- Note that you will need to use `sudo` for all docker commands, by default. To avoid this [additional steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) are required.

Ensure that docker is running by running the following command - it should run without any errors.

```shell
docker ps
```

### RSKJ Docker Images

Dockerfiles corresponding to the different environments can be downloaded from the [RSK Artifacts](https://github.com/rsksmart/artifacts/tree/master/Dockerfiles/RSK-Node) page.
If you wish, you may follow the instructions there to build
the Mainnet and Testnet nodes.

For this tutorial however, we will be using a `Dockerfile` and configuration
that are pre-prepared, and located within this tutorial folder.

### Start RSKJ Container for a RegTest Node

For this quick start tutorial, we are going to use the `RegTest` docker

Run this command to build a RSKJ node for RegTest

```shell
cd <tutorial-root>/docker/
docker build -t regtest -f Dockerfile.RegTest .
```

This creates a docker image, containing an RSK node
which is configured with the contents of
[`regtest.conf`](https://github.com/rsksmart/truffle-integration/blob/staging/docker/regtest.conf).
The final line of output for this should look similar to `Successfully tagged regtest:latest`.

Start a container with the built image. This command will start an RSKJ node with port 4444, 4445 and 30305 open.

```shell
docker run -d \
 --name regtest-node-01 \
 -p 4444:4444 \
 -p 4445:4445 \
 -p 30305:30305 \
 regtest:latest
```

For Windows, it must be in a single line:
```shell
docker run -d --name regtest-node-01 -p 4444:4444 -p 4445:4445 -p 30305:30305 regtest:latest
```

If the container runs successfully, you should get an output that is a hash, for example: `2f75d6c3f08dc15232be42ed2dabcc370742b3dd573f45fcac7253abce151f9d`.

You should be able to view the shell output for the container.
Instead of the container ID, you may also use the hash that was output previously.

```shell
docker container logs --follow regtest-node-01
# or:
docker container logs --follow 2f75d6c3f08dc15232be42ed2dabcc370742b3dd573f45fcac7253abce151f9d
```

You should see this in the logs: `INFO success: rsk entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)`.
That indicates that an RSKJ node is running within this docker container.

### Testing the nodes

### HTTP

RSK nodes allow you to connect over HTTP,
which is exposed on port `4444`.
Let us verify that this works.

In a terminal which supports curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4444/1.1.0/ \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

This should respond with something that looks like the following:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x2db0b"}
```
You can enter any other valid JSON-RPC commands as the `POST` body.

### Websockets

The RSK nodes also allow you to connect over websockets,
which are exposed on port `4445`.
Let us verify that this works too.

```bash
npx wscat -c ws://localhost:4445/websocket
```

If you have not installed [`wscat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) globally before, wait for it to do so,
and then it will load up its own shell.

```text
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
>
```

Again, you can enter any valid JSON-RPC command in the prompt.
Be sure to check that you receive a valid and expected response.

For example, enter the following:

```json
> {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber", "params": [], "id":1}
```

This should respond with something that looks like the following:

```json
< {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x72"}
```

### Cleaning up

After finishing the tutorial, you can use the following commands to shut down (`kill`) or remove (`rm`) the container.

```shell
docker container list
docker kill <container id>
docker rm <container id>
```

For the above example, `<container id>` is `regtest-node-01`.
