# Step 3 : Edit Smart Contract

In the previous step we setup tools for building and deploying smart contracts on a local test blockchain. Let's now use these for playing ...
In this tutorial, we have two sample smart contracts available to experiment with.

- MyToken.sol: an ERC20 token that uses the [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) implementation of [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) tokens. By deriving the OpenZeppelin ERC20 token we create our own token by providing the parameters for constructor. You can customize these parameters to adapt your own token.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}
}
```
You may change the parameters to adapt the name and symbol of the token.

## Understand the Smart Contract Files

Note that EIP stands for 'Ethereum Improvement Proposal' and ERC stands for 'Ethereum Request for Comments'. Then both are the referring the same specifcation, the former is the issue and a fix proposal, the later is a 'Standard' proposal for this fix.

[`IERC20.sol`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsksmart/truffle-integration/staging/truffle/contracts/erc20/IERC20.sol) defines the interface (the required functions to implement) for the ERC20 based standard token.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

/**
 * @title ERC20 interface
 * @dev see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20
 */
interface IERC20 {
  function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

  function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256);

  function allowance(address owner, address spender)
    external view returns (uint256);

  function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);

  function approve(address spender, uint256 value)
    external returns (bool);

  function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value)
    external returns (bool);

  event Transfer(
    address indexed from,
    address indexed to,
    uint256 value
  );

  event Approval(
    address indexed owner,
    address indexed spender,
    uint256 value
  );
}
```

[`ERC20.sol`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsksmart/truffle-integration/staging/truffle/contracts/erc20/ERC20.sol) provides implementations of the functions declared in [`IERC20.sol`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsksmart/truffle-integration/staging/truffle/contracts/erc20/IERC20.sol).
Here is the implementation of the functions that we looked at in the interface. Note that some events are also defined.

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
