## Step 4 : Deploy to MainNet

Deploying Smart Contracts to RSK MainNet can follow the same steps as the TestNet.

#### MainNet Node
The public node of RSK Main Net is https://public-node.rsk.co

#### MainNet Explorer
You will be able to check the MainNet's transactions and blocks in real time at this address
https://explorer.rsk.co/

#### Get RBTC through 2-way peg
To deploy onto MainNet, we need to get some RBTC through the 2-way pg mechanism between BTC and RBTC.
