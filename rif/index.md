## RIF Services

Root Infrastructure Framework Open Standard (RIF OS) is a suite of open and decentralized infrastructure protocols that enable faster, easier and scalable development of distributed applications (dApps) within a unified environment.

RIF OS is an all in one, easy to use, blockchain infrastructure service framework that provides developers and organizations access to a variety of services across multiple crypto-economies.

RIF OS Protocols enable broad interoperability and faster time-to-deployment, and aim to bridge the gap between blockchain technologies and their mass-market adoption. RIF OS Protocols complete the RSK Smart Contract Network vision of bringing the Internet of Value to life.

#### RIF Name Service

RNS is a decentralized service that allows users to have a readable domain or alias. It can be used to identify other personal resources, such as payment or communication addresses.

#### RIF Lumino Network 

RIF Lumino Network is a third-layer solution to the Bitcoin blockchain, that enables state channels for every token built on RSK increasing transaction throughput and reduces costs by orders of magnitude.

#### RIF FAQ

Q: What’s the relationship between RIF services and the RSK platform?

A: RIF services are implementations of the RIF OS Protocols that anybody following the protocols can build. RIF Labs in particular choose to build its implementation of RIF OS Protocols on top of the RSK Smart Contract Network because of its unique position as the first open-source smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network. All RIF OS Protocols implementations share in common a set of interfaces and the acceptance of RIF token as payment means.

Q: What’s the relationship between RIF Labs and the RSK platform?

A: RIF Labs acquired RSK Labs the company behind the construction of the open source RSK Smart Contract Network. Also given RSK Smart unique position as the first open source Smart Contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network it also choose to implement its RIF OS Protocols on top of it. For clear strategic reasons RIF Labs will take the lead on technology development and community growth for the the ecosystem as a whole.

Both the RIF OS Protocols and RSK Smart Contract Network share the same principles and mission, and now they will be supported by the combined teams of RIF Labs and RSK Labs. Together, we will continue our focus of improving the lives of millions excluded around the world by building this next generation blockchain-based infrastructure that will bring to life the Internet of Value.

Q: Why RIF Labs built RIF OS Protocols on top of the RSK Smart Contract Network?

A: We chose to continue building on top of RSK Smart because of its unique position as the first open-source smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network. The goal of the RSK Smart Contract Network and RIF OS Protocols is to add value and extend the functionality of the Bitcoin ecosystem by integrating smart-contracts, near-instant payments, and greater stability. This will also allow projects to access a variety of decentralized infrastructure services, from payments to storage, and speed up time-to-market.

RSK is the first open-source smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network that is:

* Bitcoin Friendliness: Bitcoin was the first and, today, the most well-secured blockchain available.
* Security: RSK blockchain is secured by merge-mining, which means that RSK can achieve the same security as Bitcoin in terms of double-spend prevention and settlement finality.
* Scalability: RSK can scale up to 100 transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization.
* Flexibility: Instant payments allow new use cases, such as retail-ready store payments and micro-credits.
* RIF Labs implemented RIF OS Protocols on top of the solid ground that RSK Smart Contract Network has built.

Q: What’s the difference between RIF token and RBTC?

A: Root Infrastructure Framework Open Standard (RIF OS) is a suite of open and decentralized infrastructure protocols that enable faster, easier and scalable development of distributed applications (dApps) within a unified environment. RIF OS includes support for decentralized, third-party, off-chain payment networks; a set of APIs for seamless and secure communications between decentralized applications; and easy-to-use interfaces for developers. Access and payment for RIF OS services are based on the RIF Token, which allows developers to access the suite of services built on top of RIF protocols such as Directory, Payments, Data Feeds, Storage and Communications including third party-developed infrastructure services, and any other apps that might be deployed on RIF’s framework that agrees to accept RIF Tokens as a means of accessing / consuming the service or app. 

RBTC is the native token of the RSK Live Mainnet and is pegged 1:1 to BTC. It's used as gas to pay for Smart Contract execution in the same way as ETH is used as gas for Ethereum. Technical users can obtain in a decentralized way by converting to and from BTC by using the bridge between the Bitcoin and RSK protocols. Less technical users can obtain RBTC from supporting exchanges like Huobi and Bitfinex among others. In order to use the RSK  and all of the applications that run on RSK (including RIFOS once it launches).
