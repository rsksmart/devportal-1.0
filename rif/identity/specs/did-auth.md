# DID authentication

### A challenge–response authentication model based on DIDs

A challenge–response authentication is a family of protocols in which one party presents a question ("challenge") and another party must provide a valid answer ("response") to be authenticated. {% include rif-id-ref.html id="10" %}

DID Auth is a protocol that allows asking the controller of an account to sign a random message, thus demonstrating control of the account at the time of the question. This protocol used as a login method checks that the user controls the account at the time of access to the application.

Additionally, it allows the application to request specific data at the time of registration, for example the user's email or phone number. These requested data follow a specific standard, which allows the client to provide it in a unified way and even cryptographically signed by a third party. This means that the application can ask the user for verifiable credentials, identifying them by their type in a unique way.

### State of the art

Nowadays, authentication is handled in a centralized way. Most applications delegate the process of authenticating users to third-party services, like [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/), relaying the authenticity of that information on those services providers. The users' information is not controlled by the users theirselves, the third-party services control it.

We believe users are not going to trust their private information to third-parties services anymore, nor applications will trust in data provided by centralized services. In addition, users will ask to disclose the minimum amount of information they can. This is the Web 3.0.

### Motivation

The motivation of this protocol is to provide user centric registration and authentication mechanisms to be used by services of the web 3.0 considering:

- Users are identified by their unique Decentralized Identifiers -DID- and blockchain addresses
- Users hold their private information in user-centric services, or even fully-decentralized platforms
- Services may require specific user's information to grant access to the service
- Services verify the integrity and authenticity of the information shared by the user
- Services perform different logic depending on the designed authentication model (we call this _the business logic_)
- Users can provide services all required information with no need of third-party services
- Services and clients in this protocol share a standard way to name particular type of data - we call this _standard schemas_

We identify two main type of services: _permissioned services_, those which require user to provide certain information to access it, and _open services_, which do not require extra info apart from the user's blockchain address.

This protocol allows services to prove that the user is in control of their Decentralized Identifier -DID- {% include rif-id-ref.html id="2" %} (thus, their blockchain account) and, optionally, enables the application require the user to share specific private information associated to their account (their Verifiable Credentials {% include rif-id-ref.html id="7" %}), in order to register them performing a custom _business logic_, enabling the service to verify that the shared information has been issued by reliable entities.

It is designed to:

1. Register users by requesting them to share specific information that can be verified - this information can be used in business logic to grant or deny access
2. Allow the user to opt-in to share their information - it is a user-centric protocol, the user decides whether to share the information or not
3. Authenticate a user by proving they control a specific DID
4. Provide an _access token_ to the user that can be reused over time - wallet systems usually request user action to sign messages. Lowering this actions improves the user experience. Enabling reusing access token reduces the amount of signatures required.

This protocol was inspired by:

- CHAP{% include rif-id-ref.html id="11" %} authentication protocol
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework{% include rif-id-ref.html id="13" %}.
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 {% include rif-id-ref.html id="2" %}.
- W3C Verifiable Credentials model {% include rif-id-ref.html id="7" %}.
- uPort selective disclosure [implementation](https://developer.uport.me/flows/selectivedisclosure)
- W3C Verifiable Credentials JSON Schema Specification {% include rif-id-ref.html id="12" %}

Initially, it is designed to use HTTPS as the message transport layer, but it can be ported to a different one.

### Sign up

Services usually register users before letting them in. This means the service requires some specific information to be shared by the user (ie: user's email).

Requiring information to the user is OPTIONAL, it depends on the service needs. Some services may not need to register users before letting them enter in. This lets identify the service in one of the two groups: _permissioned_ or _open_.

1. _Client_ sends `POST /request-signup { did }` to _Service_, where `did` is _User_'s DID
2. _Service_ creates a random deterministic* _challenge_. Responds with `{ challenge, sdr? }` were `sdr?` is the OPTIONAL [selective disclosure request](#request) defined by the _Service_. The `sdr` MUST be sent in a signed JWT format.
3. If `sdr`, _Client_ obtains the information required from the user's desired service or platform (for example, from the [RIF Data Vault](../../data-vault)), and builds a [selective disclosure](#response) (response)
4. _Client_ pormpts user to sign a message with the following format using `personal_sign` as per EIP-191{% include rif-id-ref.html id="16" %} and EIP-155{% include rif-id-ref.html id="15" %}:
  ```
Login to <web domain>
Verification code: <challenge>
My credentials are: <array of JWT credentials separated by commas>
  ```
  where `<web domain>` is the site DNS domain and `<array of JWT credentials>` is the selective disclosure (which is set if `sdr` was asked*). For example
  ```
Login to taringa.net
Verification code: 4531
My credentials are: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkaWQ6ZXRocjpyc2s6MHhjMmE0MWY3NmNhY2ZhOTMzYzM0OTY5NzdmMjE2MDk0NGVmOGMyZGUzIiwicm9sZSI6IlJJRiBEZXZlbG9wZXIiLCJpc3MiOiJkaWQ6ZXRocjpyc2s6MHg0Y2MxNzc0MjI2NDNjMzgxNGE5ZThhNzY1NDk4NTIxYzUyMDRmMTExIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.3sauMI60RVqc1QrvooZnNnmjAMiHj4qt5ZSEYhOULvA,eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkaWQ6ZXRocjpyc2s6MHhjMmE0MWY3NmNhY2ZhOTMzYzM0OTY5NzdmMjE2MDk0NGVmOGMyZGUzIiwic2tpbGxzIjoiQmxvY2tjaGFpbiIsImlzcyI6ImRpZDpldGhyOnJzazoweDRjYzE3NzQyMjY0M2MzODE0YTllOGE3NjU0OTg1MjFjNTIwNGYxMTEiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.SgPPVFj0lU9E_dq_aPOmrf_CZljNh1ZaEhAufAbIgFY
  ```
5. _User_ signs the message with the DID controller's private key. _Client_ sends to _Service_
  ```
POST /signup {
  did: <signer's DID>,
  sig: <message signature>,
  credentials: <array of JWT credentials> 
}
  ```
  For the given example it is
  ```json
{ 
  "did": "did:ethr:rsk:0xa53...dec",
  "sig": "...",
  "credentials": [
    "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkaWQ6ZXRocjpyc2s6MHhjMmE0MWY3NmNhY2ZhOTMzYzM0OTY5NzdmMjE2MDk0NGVmOGMyZGUzIiwicm9sZSI6IlJJRiBEZXZlbG9wZXIiLCJpc3MiOiJkaWQ6ZXRocjpyc2s6MHg0Y2MxNzc0MjI2NDNjMzgxNGE5ZThhNzY1NDk4NTIxYzUyMDRmMTExIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.3sauMI60RVqc1QrvooZnNnmjAMiHj4qt5ZSEYhOULvA,eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkaWQ6ZXRocjpyc2s6MHhjMmE0MWY3NmNhY2ZhOTMzYzM0OTY5NzdmMjE2MDk0NGVmOGMyZGUzIiwic2tpbGxzIjoiQmxvY2tjaGFpbiIsImlzcyI6ImRpZDpldGhyOnJzazoweDRjYzE3NzQyMjY0M2MzODE0YTllOGE3NjU0OTg1MjFjNTIwNGYxMTEiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.SgPPVFj0lU9E_dq_aPOmrf_CZljNh1ZaEhAufAbIgFY"
  ]
}
  ```
6. _Service_ receives the `response` and recovers the signer against this message (_Service_ needs the _User_'s DID to fetch the expected challenge):
  ```
Login to {SERVICE_EXPECTED_DOMAIN}
Verification code: {EXPECTED_CHALLENGE}
My credentials are: {response.credentials.join(',')}
  ```
  Then checks message signer matches `response.did`'s address, and performs business logic over the selective disclosure. If business logic is successful, it logs the user in by creating an _access token_ and a _refresh token_:
  - The _access token_ is a JWT signed with the service controller DID's private key. The JWT MUST have, at least, the following payload:
    ```javascript
{
  iss: `${serviceDid}`,
  aud: `${serviceUrl}`,
  sub: `${userDid}`,
  exp: `${now + 10 min}`, // should be shorter than 15 minutes
  nbf: `${now}`,
  iat: `${now}`
}
    ```
    Other claims could be useful for storing user metadata and other use case related information.
  - The _refresh token_ is an opaque string (could be a random one) that will be associated to user session data in the server. It has a long expiration
  - The HTTP status is 200 and the body is
    ```javascript
{ accessToken, refreshToken }
    ```

> *The credential format is not friendly for the user: they cannot understand what they are signing. Future work will research on finding a more user-oriented form to display the JWTs but with current technology this is what we can do. Ideally EIP-712 could be used to show display JWTs in user-oriented form.

See [authenticating requests](#authenticating-requests) to understand how to user _access_ and _refresh_ tokens.

![did auth](../assets/img/10_did_auth_sign_up.png)

The selective disclosure request is optional and it depends on the service needs.
- Open apps need just a proof that the user is in control of the DID at the time of access. In that case the `challenge` is enough
- Permissioned apps need a proof that the user is in control of the DID and also proofs that the user fulfil the business needs when disclosing their information. IE: be older than 18 years old.

> *The challenge may be non-deterministic, in that case, the service will have to store the challenges state. See [How to calculate a deterministic challenge](#how-to-calculate-a-deterministic-challenge)

#### Selective disclosure

It is strongly based on [uPort implementation](https://developer.uport.me/flows/selectivedisclosure), where the service requires certain information and the user responds with it.

The selective disclosure request must be compatible with [uPort DAF implementation](https://github.com/uport-project/daf/blob/d7714e5b3c2f00a90a861488deb2d37fba750173/packages/daf-selective-disclosure/src/action-handler.ts#L16-L23), so it must implement the following interfaces.

##### Request

```typescript
interface Claim {
  claimType: string
  claimValue: string
  reason?: string
  essential?: boolean
}

interface SelectiveDisclosureRequest {
  issuer: string
  subject: string
  replyUrl?: string
  claims?: Claim[]
  credentials?: string[]
}
```

- `issuer`: the service did. REQUIRED
- `subject`: the user did (the one received when requesting the challenge). REQUIRED
- `replyUrl`: the sign up endpoint.
- `claims`: needed claims that may or not be part of a credential. IE: `preferredLanguage`.
- `credentials`: array of W3C Verifiable Credentials JSON Schema names. Those schemas definitions will be published in an open repository in Github. IE: `EmailCredential`, `BirthdateCredential`.

##### Response

```typescript
interface SelectiveDisclosureResponse {
  issuer: string
  subject: string
  claims?: Claim[]
  credentials: VerifiableCredential[]
}
```

- `issuer`: the user did. REQUIRED
- `subject`: the service did. REQUIRED
- `claims`: requested claims. IE: `{ claimType: 'preferredLanguage', claimValue: 'english' }`
- `credentials`: array of W3C Verifiable Credentials that implements the requested JSON schemas

### Login

Services should use _login_ after [signin up](#sign-up) users. This means the service already obtained the information required to let the user access the service.

1. _Client_ sends `POST /request-auth { did }` to _Service_, where `did` is _User_'s DID
2. _Service_ creates a random deterministic* _challenge_ to send to _Client_ and responds with `{ challenge }`.
3. _Client_ signs a message with  the following format using `personal_sign` as per EIP-191{% include rif-id-ref.html id="16" %} and EIP-155{% include rif-id-ref.html id="15" %}:
  ```
Login to <web domain>
Verification code: <challenge>
  ```
  _Client_ prompts the _User_ to sign it with DID controller's private key.
5. _Client_ sends  to _Service_
  ```
POST /auth {
  did: <signer's DID>,
  sig: <message signature>
}
  ```
6. _Service_ receives the `response` and recovers the signer against this message:
  ```
Login to {SERVICE_EXPECTED_DOMAIN}
Verification code: {EXPECTED_CHALLENGE}
My credentials are: {response.credentials.join(',')}
  ```
  Then checks message signer matches `response.did`'s address. If necessary, performs business logic over the `did` and the information related to it saved by the _Service_. If it is a valid user, it creates an _access token_ and a _refresh token_ - see ([sign up](#sign-up) to understand required token JWT payload format)

See [authenticating requests](#authenticating-requests) to understand how to user _access_ and _refresh_ tokens.

> *The challenge may be non-deterministic, in that case, the service will have to store the challenges state. See [How to calculate a deterministic challenge](#how-to-calculate-a-deterministic-challenge)

![did auth](../assets/img/08_did_auth_login.png)

### Authenticating requests

After the user is registered and has logged in (meaning the user is holding an _access token_ and a _refresh token_) the flow for authenticating following requests is:

7. _Client_ authenticates next HTTP requests using the received _access token_. See [how to send access tokens](#access-token).
8. _Service_ receives access token. If the _access token_ is not expired, it authorizes the request. If not, it answers with an HTTP 401 with `"Expired access token"` string as HTTP body.
9. If _Client_ receives HTTP 401, sends `POST /refresh-token` to _Service_ including the _refresh token_. See [how to send refresh tokens](#refresh-token).
10. _Service_ validates the _refresh token_ and the current session status. If valid, issues new _access token_ (with same data but new expiration), invalidates the received _refresh token_ and issues a new one. The HTTP status is 200 and the body is
  ```javascript
{ accessToken, refreshToken }
  ```
11. _Client_ authenticates next HTTP requests using the received _access token_.
12. _Service_ authorizes the request.

![did auth](../assets/img/11_did_auth_access.png)

### Logout

This operation will invalidate the current user's session. The next time `/refresh-token` is invoked, it will not generate a new _access token_.

1. _Client_s sends `POST /logout` with the current _access token_
2. If the _access token_ is valid, _Service_ marks the associated _refresh token_ as logged out.
3. _Client_ sends `POST /refresh-token` to _Service_ with the `refresh token`
4. _Service_ does not refresh the _access token_ because the session was closed before.

NOTE: The logout process does not invalidate the current _access token_, it will still be valid until it expires, that's why it matters to implement short validity periods for _access token_. The logout just prevents the _access token_ to be renewed.

## Implementations

- [`@rsksmart/express-did-auth`](../../rlogin/implementation/express-did-auth) - in progress

## Extensions

- Separate authentication server from resource server. The goal is to differentiate the server that keeps the session data from the one that has the resources (API), so this last server could be stateless. By doing so, the user authenticates and refresh tokens with a Security Token Service that emits tokens can be used in another services that owns the business resources (ie: `/products`)
- Allow the user to express control of different identities in a private manner. Lets the user use different identities for a single registration

## Open work

- Build a repository and define discovery method held by the client for W3C Verifiable Credentials JSON Schema definitions when `sdr` is requested
- Abstract the protocol from the transport layer

## Appendix

### How to calculate a deterministic challenge

Calculate a deterministic challenge prevents the server to maintain a state of emitted challenges while those challenges are valid for a certain amount of time.

Example:

```
const challengeExpirationTime = 5min
const serverSecret = 'this is the server super secret'
const userDid = `did:ethr:rsk:0x0123456789abcdef`

const timestamp = int(now / challengeExpirationTime)

const challenge = keccak256(userDid-serverSecret-timestamp`)
```

By doing this, the `challenge` will be valid for the next `challengeExpirationTime - now % challengeExpirationTime`. Once the user sends the signed challenge back to the service, the server MUST perform the same calculation and the received challenge must be coincident with the result of that new calculation, if not, an invalid challenge response will be sent.

### How to send tokens

There are different options to send the _access token_ and the _refresh token_. Request headers, request body or cookies can be used depending on the case and the developer election, please find below the different descriptions.

NOTE: If you decide to use cookies, please make sure that your service is secure enough to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery ([CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)) atttacks.

##### Access token

###### Authorization Header

It must be placed in the `Authorization` header following the `DIDAuth` scheme. This scheme will be present in HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry{% include rif-id-ref.html id="14" %}.

For example:

```
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: DIDAuth my.access.token
```

###### Cookie

When the client performs a `POST /auth`, the server must set the `authorization` cookie with the following attributes: `HttpOnly`, `Secure` and `SameSite=Strict` (this new attribute prevents CSRF, but it is not supported by all the browsers yet). See more information about cookies [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

For example:

```
Set-Cookie: authorization=my.access.token; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
```

Then, the client browser will send the cookie on every request.

##### Refresh token

###### Body

It must be placed in the body of the request as a `refreshToken` field.

For example:

```
POST /refresh-token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com

{
  refreshToken: 'theRefreshToken'
}
```

###### Cookie

When the client performs a `POST /auth`, the server must set the `refresh-token` cookie with the following attributes: `HttpOnly`, `Secure` and `SameSite=Strict`. 

For example:

```
Set-Cookie: refresh-token=theRefreshToken; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
```

Then, the client browser will send the cookie on every request, so when the client makes a `POST /refresh-token`, the server will replace the existing cookies (`authorization` and `refresh-token`) with new values.
