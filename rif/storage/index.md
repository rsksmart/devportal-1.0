title: About RIF Storage
---

RIF Storage is an open, censorship resistant, permissionless and decentralized storage protocol. It provides a unified interface to 3rd party decentralized storage providers like [IPFS](/rif/storage/providers/ipfs) or [Swarm](/rif/storage/providers/swarm). We are adding incentives to these systems to ensure resistance to trivial attacks, availability and to allow participants to be rewarded for their participation in the network.

As an end-user RIF Storage allows you to take back ownership of your data. Even if the service you are using stops existing you can retrieve all your content.

As a developer/service creator RIF Storage allows you to not worry about storage for your application. It also comes with content delivery service out of the box so your application scales without you having to invest in additional infrastructure.

Thanks to the built-in incentives, anyone can become a storage provider by offering their unused storage to others and getting paid for it.
