IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. At its core it is a versioned file system which can store files and track versions over time, very much like Git. It also defines how files move across a network, making it a distributed file system, much like BitTorrent. In combining these two properties, IPFS enables a new permanent web and augments the way we use existing internet protocols like HTTP.
