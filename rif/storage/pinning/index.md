## RIF Storage Pinning service
The RIF Storage Pinning service, offered together with the RIF Marketplace, is a service that allows Storage Providers to list their offers and enter in storage agreements with consumers, which can pay using different methods such as RBTC or RIF tokens.

## Repositories
 - [Pinning Service](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-storage-pinner): A nodejs service which listens on Providers offer and pins/unpins files from Provider running IPFS node
 - [Storage Smart Contracts](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-storage): A smart contract registry which stores the offers and agreements.
 - [Pinning CLI](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-storage-cli): CLI tool for interacting with the Storage Smart Contracts
 - [Pinning UI](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-storage-pinning-ui): Simple UI for development purposes which interacts with the Storage Smart Contracts

Additional information for the Pinning service can be found in [RIF Marketplace-Services-Storage](/rif/marketplace/services/storage/techspecs)
