Use this service to **keep track of transactions** sent via Gnosis Safe contracts. Transactions are detected in an automatic way, so there is no need of informing the service about the transactions.

To allow **offchain collecting of signatures**, transactions can also be sent to the service, informing the owners about a transaction that is pending to be sent to the blockchain.
