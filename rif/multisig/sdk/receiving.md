It is important to understand that in order to properly receive funds, the Multisig account address (instead of the owner address) must be used as receiver.

Assuming the Multisig account was created by means of [EthersSafeFactory](/rif/multisig/sdk/creation):

```ts
const safeSdk = await safeFactory.createSafe({
  owners: ['0x1234...', '0xabcd...', '0x0987...'],
  threshold: 2
})

// address to use as fund receiver
const multisigAccountAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()
```

## RBTC

Here below an example of transaction executed for funding the Multisig account using [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)

```ts
// address to use as fund receiver
const multisigAccountAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()

const valueToSend = BigNumber.from("1000000000")
await signer.sendTransaction({
    to: multisigAccountAddress,
    value: valueToSend
})
```

For further details, please have a look at:
- [signer.sendTransaction](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-sendTransaction)
- [provider.sendTransaction](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-sendTransaction)


## ERC20

Assuming we have a ERC20-compliant contract:

```ts
const erc20Token: Contract;
```

```ts
// address to use as fund receiver
const multisigAccountAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()

const valueToSend = BigNumber.from("1000000000")
await erc20Token.transfer(multisigAccountAddress, valueToSend)
```
