# Dependencies

## Prerequisites

0. node v10 (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with node v10 installed)
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
The recommended way to install IPFS is using [ipfs-update](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-update) but there are other ways described [here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs#install) as well. Recommended is to run the latest version but required is at least `0.7.0`.

# Setup:

## 1. Developers Environment

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Developer Environment

```shell
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-dev.git

cd rif-marketplace-dev
```

### 1.1. Starting docker

Now you can start docker with

```shell
docker-compose up
```
The Ganache blockchain will now run and it is available to deploy the corresponding Smart Contracts.

### 1.2. Deploying smart contracts

First, install the dependencies (make sure to **use node v10**, you can switch using `nvm use 10`).

```shell
sh install.sh rns storage
```

Run the deployment script for the RNS and Marketplace contracts deploying to ganache network.

```shell
sh deploy.sh rns storage
```

This will create `./out` folder with a number of configuration files:

- `ui-config.json` -
(**Optional**) the configuration file for the [RIF Marketplace UI](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui). This contains information for all the networks which are deployed. This should be put in the `rif-marketplace-ui/src/ui-config.json`.
- `cache-[network]-config.json` -
(**Optional**) Specific per network configuration file for the [RIF Marketplace Cache](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache) service. The configuration should be in `rif-marketplace-cache/config/local.json`.
- `rnsAdmin-[network]-config.json` -
Per network configuration file for the [RNS Domains Manager](https://github.com/rnsdomains/rns-manager-react). The configuration should be in `rns-manager-react/src/config/contracts.local.json`.

### 1.3. Browser wallet

In MetaMask or Nifty import the first address from `keys.txt` file. The private key is `0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d`

Connect to the local ganache network (`localhost:8545` in the network dropdown). You should now see a balance of 99 ETH (or close to that - some gas was already used to deploy the Contracts).

Now we will add RIF token. Click on `Add Token` -> `Custom Token` and input the token address that is in `./out/ui-config.json` under the `rif` attribute (should be `0x67B5656d60a809915323Bf2C40A8bEF15A152e3e` if this is your first deployment). You should now see your RIF tokens balance of 997 RIF.

You can similarly add more accounts to your wallet if needed.

### 1.4. IPFS Nodes

For this setup you will need at least two running instances of **IPFS**. These can be spawned and ran easily through the **RIF Storage Pinning** repository, which will provide two instances already configured and ready to be used by the **RIF Marketplace**.

Download and setup the Pinning service

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-storage-pinner.git
$ cd rif-storage-pinner
$ npm ci
```

Initialize development repos that are placed in `.repos`.  This folder can be anytime removed and the `init` command rerun. All data will be purged though.

```shell
$ npm run init
```

Spawn IPFS daemons

```shell
$ npm run ipfs:consumer daemon
$ npm run ipfs:provider daemon
```

You can use NPM's scripts `npm run ipfs:consumer` and `npm run ipfs:provider` to interact with each IPFS node. These take the same arguments as the `ipfs` command.

You should now have two instances of **IPFS** running on ports `5002` and `5003`.

## 2. RIF Marketplace Cache

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Cache

```shell
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache.git

cd rif-marketplace-cache
```

Install the dependencies

```shell
npm ci
```

Create the DB using the following command:

```shell
npm run bin -- db-migration --up
```

Run Precache process for the RNS Service (for ganache network):

```shell
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin precache rns storage
```

Run the cache for the RNS Service with

```shell
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin -- start --enable rns storage --log=debug
```

## 3. RIF Marketplace Upload Service

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Upload Service.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-upload-service.git

cd rif-marketplace-upload-service
```

Install the dependencies.

```shell
npm ci
```

Create the DB using the following command:

```shell
npm run bin -- db-migration --up
```

Run Upload Service (connected to previously deployed IPFS node).

```shell
NODE_ENV=development npm run bin start -- --log=debug
```

## 4. RIF Marketplace UI

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace UI.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui.git

cd rif-marketplace-ui
```

Install the dependencies.

```shell
npm ci
```

Run the UI (Will be available on `http://localhost:3000/`).

```shell
npm start
```

## 5. RNS Manager

Download and setup the RNS Manager.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:rnsdomains/rns-manager-react.git

cd rns-manager-react
```

Install the dependencies.

```shell
npm i
```

Copy the configuration file generated in step [1.2](#12-deploying-smart-contracts) from `rif-marketplace-dev/out/rnsAdmin-ganache-config.json` into `rns-manager-react/src/config/contracts.local.json`.

Now you can start the UI. (You may need to switch to another port such as `http://localhost:3001` if you are already running the RIF Marketplace UI).

```shell
npm start
```

## 6. RIF Storage Pinning service

> This is a service that listens on blockchain events and when new Agreement is created it pins a file to the configured IPFS node.

Download and setup the Pinning service (already done when running **IPFS** nodes).

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-storage-pinner.git
$ cd rif-storage-pinner
$ npm ci
```

Make sure you have **IPFS** installed. We will use one of the previously deployed instances of **IPFS**.

To interact with pinning service use the `npm run bin` script. To start Pinning service run:

```shell
npm run bin -- init --offerId={your_account} --db=./db.sqlite
```

This will provide the `peerId` that should be used in the *RIF Marketplace UI*  to create the Storage offer. You can create the offer on `http://localhost:3000/storage/sell?peerId={your_peer_id}`.

Once the offer is created in the UI you can run the service using:

```shell
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin daemon -- --log=debug --db=./db.sqlite
```

You should see in logs when new Agreements are detected and pinned.

**NOTE:** See help pages for details on the parameters and additional commands!!!

# Using the RIF Marketplace

## Forwarding the Blockchain (Confirmations)

In order to complete the required operations and get the required number of Confirmations, you will need to run the following script to mine new blocks after each single transaction (both during the RNS registration flow and also when you Buy and Sell RNS Domains)

```shell
sh forward.sh
```
