# Dependencies

## Prerequisities
0. node v10 (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with node v10 installed)
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Part of tutorial
These will be installed during the tutorial

3. [RIF Marketplace Developer Environment](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-dev/) project
4. [RIF Marketplace Cache](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache/) project
5. [RIF Marketplace UI](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui/) project

# Setup:
## 1. Developers Environment
Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Developer Environment
```
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-dev.git

cd rif-marketplace-dev
```

### 1.1. Starting docker
Now you can start docker with
```
docker-compose up
```

The Ganache blockchain will now run and it is available to deploy the corresponding Smart Contracts.


### 1.2. Deploying smart contracts
First, install the dependencies (make sure to **use node v10**, you can switch using `nvm use 10`). 

```
sh install.sh rns 
```

Run the deployment script for the RNS and Marketplace contracts deploying to ganache network
```
sh deploy.sh rns 
```

This will create `./out` folder with a number of configuration files:

- `ui-config.json` - (**Optional**) the configuration file for the [RIF Marketplace UI](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui). This contains information for all the networks which are deployed. This should be put in the `rif-marketplace-ui/src/ui-config.json`.
- `cache-[network]-config.json` - (**Optional**) Specific per network configuration file for the [RIF Marketplace Cache](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache) service. The configuration should be in `rif-marketplace-cache/config/local.json`.
- `rnsAdmin-[network]-config.json` - Per network conguration file for the [RNS Domains Manager](https://github.com/rnsdomains/rns-manager-react). The configuration should be in `rns-manager-react/src/config/contracts.local.json`.



### 1.3. Browser wallet
In MetaMask or Nifty import the first address from `keys.txt` file. The private key is `0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d`

Connect to the local ganache network (`localhost:8545` in the network dropdown). You should now see a balance of 99 ETH (or close to that - some gas was already used to deploy the Contracts)

Now we will add RIF token. Click on `Add Token` -> `Custom Token` and input the token address that is in `./out/ui-config.json` under the `rif` attribute (should be `0x67B5656d60a809915323Bf2C40A8bEF15A152e3e` if this is your first deployment). You should now see your RIF tokens balance of 997 RIF.

You can similarly add more accounts to your wallet if needed.

## 2. RIF Marketplace Cache
Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Cache
```
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache.git

cd rif-marketplace-cache
```

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Create the DB using the following command:
```
npm run bin db-sync
```

Run Precache process for the RNS Service 
```
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin precache rns rates
```

Run the cache for the RNS Service with
```
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin -- start --enable rns --log=debug
```

## 3. RIF Marketplace UI
Download and setup the RIF Marketplace UI
```
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui.git

cd rif-marketplace-ui
```

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Run the UI (Will be available on `http://localhost:3000/`)
```
npm start
```


## 4. RNS Manager
Download and setup the RNS Manager
```
git clone git@github.com:rnsdomains/rns-manager-react.git

cd rns-manager-react
```

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Copy the configuration file generated in step [1.2](#12-deploying-smart-contracts) from `rif-marketplace-dev/out/rnsAdmin-ganache-config.json` into `rns-manager-react/src/config/contracts.local.json`.

Now you can start the UI. (You may need to switch to another port such as `http://localhost:3001` if you are already running the RIF Marketplace UI)

```
npm start
```

# Using the RIF Marketplace

## Forwarding the Blockchain (Confirmations)
In order to complete the required operations and get the required number of Confirmations, you will need to run the following script to mine new blocks after each single transaction (both during the RNS registration flow and also when you Buy and Sell RNS Domains)

```sh
sh forward.sh
```
