RIF Name Service (RNS) enables the use of human readable names for blockchain addresses helping users to receive transactions in personalized domains. The Name Services (RNS) Marketplace allows users to buy and sell RNS domains. Sellers can list their owned domains and set a listing price in RIF for each of them. Buyers  can browse the available Domains and purchase the one they prefer by paying the listed price.

### Components

![RNS Architecture](/assets/img/rif-marketplace/rifmkt-rns-arch.png)

The main **high-level components** are:

The architectre is composed of service-specific **smart contracts** deployed on the RSK blockchain, a shared read-only **cache** for performance and scalability, and a **front-end (UI)** application which allows users to easily connect, browse the available services and interact with other Marketplace participants. 

 - **RIF Marketplace UI** - the main web UI where all transactions originate.
 - **Cache** - a cache that stores the state of the Smart Contract in an easy-readable format and does some basic preprocessing on it.
 - **Smart Contract** - where the state of RNS Domains buying/selling transactions is stored and managed.


## Implementation notes

### Currency Conversions

There is a `rates` service implemented in the Cache which periodically gets the currency conversion rates between all relevant currencies and tokens and stores this information in the database.

### Key management 

Keys are kept at the user's normal Wallet (e.g., Metamask), and all transactions will be originating from RIF Marketplace UI where they will be signed using this Wallet. 

### Name Resolution
Depending on the time and the way a domain was registered by the user it may be possible that the readable domain cannot be obtained. This is due to the way on which RNS domains are stored on the blockchain as hashes and not in the readable form. In these cases the RIF Marketplace UI will display an *Unknown(0x123..)* label for those domains.
