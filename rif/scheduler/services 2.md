The Service Providers will run the _scheduler service_ that will
track all new requested transactions and execute them in the correct time

> See [this guide](../run) to run a scheduler on your own

## Architecture

The service works as a _cach√©_ system.
It collects information from another source of trust: The smart contract.

- Stores the requested transactions in a SQLite database (configurable)
- Runs every 5 minutes collecting transactions that
  need to be executed (configurable)
- Connects to RSK node using web sockets --
  it uses `eth_getLogs` and `eth_subscribe` RPC methods
- It executes transactions storing a private key in a file --
  this can be easily improved
- It does not expose any HTTP API

## Model

It has 5 core components

- **Recoverer** --
  recovers all the requested executions when the service was asleep
- **Listener** --
  notifies the service when new executions are listed
- **Collector** --
  recurrently collects all the transactions that need to be executed
- **Scheduler** --
  sets alarms for collected executions
- **Executor** --
  executes the requested transaction at the given time

The service in designed to allow any of its modules
to be switched for different implementations.
For example, it is easy to change the _scheduler_ module to
implement a different scheduling technique.
