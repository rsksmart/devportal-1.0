Resolvers may implement any subset of the record types specified here. Where a record types specification requires a resolver to provide multiple functions, the resolver MUST implement either all or none of them.

Resolvers MUST specify a fallback function that throws.

Resolvers must implement [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) interface detection standard. `supportsInterface` method must return if the `interfaceID` queried is simply equal to the signature hash of the function that resolves the desired resource record.

Currently standardized resolver interfaces are specified below.

> Check out [definitive resolver](/rif/rns/architecture/definitive-resolver) for implementation details.

### Contract address

Provides the contract address for the specified domain.

```solidity
function addr(bytes32 node) returns (address);
```

- `node`: the namehash of the domain to query for.
- Returns the contract address of the specified domain. A zero address is returned if the node has no address specified.

When updated emits

```solidity
event AddrChanged(bytes32 indexed node, address a);
```

Interface ID: `0x3b3b57de`

Specification: [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137#resolver-specification)

Resolution protocol:

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `addr` to the resolver contract.
3. Check for non zero-address response.

> No modifications to the adoption of this protocol.

### Multicoin address

Add multiple `addr` fields for resolvers, which permit resolution of addresses across multiple blockchains.

```solidity
function addr(bytes32 node, uint coinType) external view returns(bytes memory);
```

- `node`: The name hash of the domain to query for.
- `coinType`: The cryptocurrency coin type index from [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- Returns the cryptocurency address in its native binary format. A zero-length string is returned if the specified coin ID does not exist on the specified node.

> Detailed descriptions of the binary encodings for several popular chains are provided in the [Address Encoding section](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304#address-encoding) of EIP-2304.

When updated emits

```solidity
event AddressChanged(bytes32 indexed node, uint coinType, bytes newAddress);
```

Specification: [EIP-2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304)

Interface ID: `0xf1cb7e06`

Deprecates: [RNSIP-03](https://github.com/rnsdomains/RNSIPs/blob/master/IPs/RNSIP03.md)

Resolution protocol:

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `addr` to the resolver contract with the specified coin type.
3. Check for non zero-length string response.

Resolvers implementing this interface may utilise a fallback strategy regarding backward compatibility.

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `addr` to the resolver contract with the specified coin type.
3. If zero-length string is returned, query `chainAddr` to the resolver contract.
4. Check for non zero-length string response.

### Contenthash

System of mapping names to network and content addresses.

```solidity
function contenthash(bytes32 node) external view returns (bytes memory);
```

- `node`: the namehash of the domain to query for.
- Returns a machine-readable multicodec representation of the content address. The format is specified as follows: `<protoCode uvarint><value []byte>`.

> `protoCode`s and their meanings are specified in the [multiformats/multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) repository.

When updated emits:

```solidity
event ContenthashChanged(bytes32 indexed node, bytes hash);
```

Interface ID: `0xbc1c58d1`

Specification: [EIP-1577](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1577)

Deprecates: `content` and [`multihash`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1577) fields.

Resolution protocol:

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `contenthash` to the resolver contract.
3. Check for non zero-length string response.

Resolvers implementing this interface may utilise a fallback strategy regarding backward compatibility.

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `contenthash` to the resolver contract.
3. If zero-length string is returned, query `multihash` to the resolver contract.
4. If zero-length string is returned, query `content` to the resolver contract.
5. Check for non zero-length string response.


### Contract ABI

Easy lookup of contract interfaces by callers

```solidity
function ABI(bytes32 node, uint256 contentType) constant returns (uint256, bytes memory);
```

- `node`: the namehash of the domain to query for.
- `contentType`: a bitwise OR of the ABI formats accepted by the caller.
- Returns the content type of the return value and the ABI data. `(0, "")` is returned if the domain has no ABI specified, or does not support any of the requested formats.

> The currently recognised encodings are described in [ABI encodings section](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-205#abi-encodings) EIP-205.

When updated emits:

```solidity
event ABIChanged(bytes32 indexed node, uint256 indexed contentType);
```

> Notice that the updated content is not emitted. It requires an extra query to get the resource record when logged, but saves gas setting it.

Interface ID: `0x2203ab56`

Specification: [EIP-205](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-205)

Resolution protocol:

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `ABI` to the resolver contract with a bitwise OR of the ABI formats accepted by the caller.
3. Check for a response that is not  `(0, "")`.

### SECP256k1 public keys

Permits the lookup of SECP256k1 public keys.

```solidity
function pubkey(bytes32 node) constant returns (bytes32 x, bytes32 y);
```

- `node`: the namehash of the domain to query for.
- Returns the coordinates of an uncompressed SECP256k1 curve point comprising the public key. A `(0, 0)` value is returned if the domain has no pubkey specified.

When updated emits:

```solidity
event PubkeyChanged(bytes32 indexed node, bytes32 x, bytes32 y);
```

Interface ID: `0xc8690233`

Specification: [EIP-619](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/619)

Resolution protocol:

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `pubkey` to the resolver contract.
3. Check for non `(0, 0)` response.

### Text records

Permits the lookup of arbitrary key-value text data.

```solidity
function text(bytes32 node, string key) constant returns (string text);
```

- `node`: the namehash of the domain to query for.
- `key`: the text data key to query.
- Returns the associated text data. If the key is not present, the zero-length string is returned.

> For supported keys refer to the [initial recommended keys section of EIP-634](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634#initial-recommended-keys).

When updated emits:

```solidity
event TextChanged(bytes32 indexed node, string indexed indexedKey, string key);
```

Interface ID: `0x59d1d43c`

Specification: [EIP-634](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634)


Resolution protocol:

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `text` to the resolver contract with the specified key.
3. Check for non zero-length string response.

### Interface discovery

Defines a method of associating contract interfaces with domains and addresses, and of discovering those interfaces.

```solidity
function interfaceImplementer(bytes32 node, bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (address);
```

- `node`: the namehash of the domain to query for.
- `interfaceID`: The EIP 165 interface ID to query for.
- Returns the address of a contract that implements the specified interface for the given domain. A zero-address value is returned if there is no interface matching that interface ID for that node.

When updated emits:

```solidity
event InterfaceChanged(bytes32 indexed node, bytes4 indexed interfaceID, address implementer);
```

Interface ID: `0xb8f2bbb4`

Specifitcation: [EIP-1844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1844)

Resolution protocol:


1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `interfaceImplementer` to the resolver contract with the specified interface ID.
4. Check for non zero-address response.

Resolvers implementing this interface may utilise a fallback strategy. This strategy has nothing to do with backward compatibility.

1. Query the resolver address to the registry.
2. Query `interfaceImplementer` to the resolver contract with the specified interface ID.
3. If zero-address string is returned, query `addr` to the resolver contract and query `supportsInterface` to the given contract address.
4. Check for non zero-address response.
