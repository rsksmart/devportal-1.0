## RIF Lumino Network

The RIF Lumino Network is the first off-chain state channel network launched on RSK. It is also a cornerstone of a broader vision called RIF Payments which will allow users to seamlessly interact with multiple cross-blockchain off-chain networks such as Lumino, Lightning and Raiden.

RIF Lumino allows to make off-chain payments on any token deployed on RSK in a fast, reliable, with low fees and secured by the Bitcoin network. RIF Lumino will be the first payment network supported by RIF Payments in his path to a global financial inclusion.

RIF Payments is a set of protocols whose primary goal is to enable fast and cheap peer-to-peer payments that could scale to achieve true world-wide financial inclusion. RIF Payments is composed of three main protocols:

1. RIF Payments Full: it is a protocol which creates an abstraction layer to access different payment networks allowing cross-token and cross-network payments.
2. RIF Payments Light: it is a protocol to allow light clients to access RIF Payments Full without jeopardizing security and decentralization.
3. RIF Payments Exchange: this protocol will be used to discover intra-token exchange rates, optimizing the routing of payments to a great extent, selecting the nodes to route payments based on their scoring, exchange rate, and fees among other criteria.
