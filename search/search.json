Developers can user rLogin project to enable Self-sovereign identity in their applications in an easy and intuitive way. The rLogin design consists of 4 core modules: A back-end authentication library A cloud storage service where users can store their credentials A standard interface for Verifiable Credentials enabling data portability A client library combining authentication against back-end using user’s wallet and store credentials A back-end authentication library Most applications have a backend, which defines the application model and an interface to interact and collaborate with the model. Users must be authenticated, that is, they must be authorized to use this model. Today one of the most used authentication methods are Google Identity or Facebook Login. A user of our application is recognized as such by having a Google or Facebook account. Google and Facebook will tell us the data that the user authorizes to share, such as their name or email. That data will be…"

The maximum gas estimation in the RelayServer is more precise now A new utility function is available to estimate the maximum gas a relay transaction would consume, based in a linear fit estimation. This can be used in applications that don’t want to sign a payload each time they need an approximation of the cost of relaying the transaction Paymaster verifications are done off-chain to optimize gas costs, thus the paymasters are now called Verifiers and they are not part of the on-chain relay flow nor they handle payments at all.

This protocol used as a login method checks that the user controls the account at the time of access to the application. Additionally, it allows the application to request specific data at the time of registration, for example the user’s email or phone number. These requested data follow a specific standard, which allows the client to provide it in a unified way and even cryptographically signed by a third party.

  "desc": "Identity layout Create and recover identities As described here RIF Identity proposes a standard model to enable users store one single secret and obtain multiple public and not associated identities. Technically, a user is going to save a seed that the wallets will use to create different private keys in a deterministic way. If all the wallets follow the same algorithm to create accounts, any wallet could correctly recover which accounts have been used before. Please make use of this section for core concept definitions So, any user can hold a mnemonic phrase to access their RIF Identity account, and from that account obtain different public Personas. Protocols This article specifies how a wallet should: Represent an identity identifier Create a new RIA, and obtain the first persona - for new users Obtain a new persona - for users that already have a RIA Recover all the used personas - for users that already had a RIA when accessing first time to the wallet This specification assumes the RIA is used in one single wallet at the same time. Represent an identity identifier Each persona has a public…"

  "desc": "File sharing systems heavily rely on users distributing files to others willingly. But strictly speaking, a user could choose to download a file and consume resources without uploading in return. Incentivization is of major importance for such systems. Why? Think for a second about whether you would like to have your laptop connected, and storing and serving file chunks from your hard-drive 24/7. No? Well, probably you are not the only one. Ask yourself another question: what would make you willing to serve chunks and contribute to a healthy network? Swarm Incentives Swarm defines the Swarm Accounting Protocol (SWAP), which is a tit-for-tat system where nodes account how much data they request and serve. Basically, this means that if a node requests a million chunks from another, it will serve one million chunks in return. However, there is a problem with this in a network of file storage. We expect a variability in network usage (a node might stream a video for 2 hours, but then be idle for the upcoming 4 hours) as well as differences in capabilities of nodes (a phone won’t be able to serve many chunks, whereas a server can). SWAP allows nodes to keep…"

Confidentiality: no third-party can read the sent messages. Integrity: prevention of a third-party of modifying the sent messages. Authenticity: prevention of impersonation of any of the endpoints. Anonymity: If enabled, nobody in the network can identify the sender or the recipient for any particular message. By using their public keys as a discovery mechanism, users can publish pseudonyms on the RIF Directory and be discoverable without the need to remember long public keys. The RIF Secure Communications Infrastructure protocol aims to fulfill the need for establishing secure links between end users, RIFOS parties or services. In addition, RIF Communication also aspires to expose a low level library suitable to be used as communication layer in decentralised applications like RSK node, Lumino network node and similar."

Citizens use a mobile wallet application where they input their identity details like name and age, and request any of these credentials to the government. The government agent accesses a web application where all the credential requests are listed and can be manually granted. Once credentials are granted, Citizens store them in a user-centric cloud storage called The Data Vault. Police officers can verify citizen’s credentials scanning a QR code using another mobile application.

From the end user’s perspective, Swarm is not that different from the world wide web. In the background, the difference is that content is hosted on a peer-to-peer storage network instead of individual servers. This peer-to-peer network is self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer-to-peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment.

  "desc": "The MVP - Learnings After this project, we have advanced in different areas of the field of self-sovereign identity. The greatest challenges are found when developing the different protocols to implement communication between applications First of all, there is no standard protocol to authenticate the identity of users when using public services. During this MVP we developed a simple authentication protocol and developed an abstract implementation simple to use in any Express.js service. This resulted in our current project called rLogin: it consists of a standard protocol to authenticate users, a front-end tool for developers to allow their users to choose any cryptocurrency wallet to operate with the services. When we try to solve the problem of communication between services, we found an interesting use case that we have not yet developed: a credential issuer could require other pre-issued credentials from a user to validate their identity. As a result of this we are working on a repository of standard schemas for credentials, which allows users to port their identity in the different models that apply verifiable credentials. Another field we explore is cloud storage: we developed a simple implementation of a data vault. Users…"

VC presentations (VP) must contain a presentation_date and, optionally, an expiration_date.

If no expiration_date is present the Verifier should have a (configurable) parameter presentation_grace from the presentation_date, for example presentation_grace=1 minute. This prevents replay attacks. A recommended verification user experience is: Verifier asks credential to Holder Holder selects a credential Holder taps on show QR button Holder shows QR Verifier scans QR Verifier app verifies VP Verifier app displays presented credentials information Verifier validates information To prove that the person presenting the credential is really the owner of the credential, it is advisable to request that they present a verified photo of themselves, or other kind of physical proof The verifier app could stablish…"

Ultimately, the vision of both Swarm and RIF is to support multiple currencies under the same network, but until that vision becomes a reality we want to give developers in the RIF ecosystem the opportunity to try out the user experience of RIF Storage, using the RIF (test) token. ## Hands-on Be one of the first to interact with the Swarm testnet and download a special surprise! ### Gateway TLDR; RIF Storage is operating a gateway service, so you can interact with Swarm without running the software yourself.

What is gas? How do I choose an appropriate gas price and limit? What happens if my transaction fails? What happens if I run out of gas? Gas in smart contracts What is gas? There are four important concepts: Gas price: The cost of the operation. Gas limit: The maximum gas the operation can afford. It’s an upper limit the user sets to prevent losing gas. Total gas: The gas the operation consumed. Also referred to as gas used. Unit: Gas is paid in RBTC. Let’s start with a simple analogy: A car. To drive a car you need gas. Gas price is the money you pay for each gallon. Gas limit is the max amount of gas you accept to consume, the gas you charge. The total gas is the amount you’ve spent at the end of the trip.

However the distribution of rewards of a block is only performed once the block reaches a certain maturity. In other words, the rewards are paid only after a fixed number of blocks have confirmed a block. With the exception of the first blocks in the blockchain after genesis, every time a block is added to the blockchain, another previous block reaches maturity and its rewards are paid. REMASC is an implementation of DECOR+ [1] How it Works The REMASC contract maintains different internal accounts. One of these internal accounts is called Reward Balance. The Reward Balance always exists and its value can change when a new block is processed because of any of the following reasons: The block was accepted on the mainchain and all its transaction fees are added to the Reward balance. Miners and other rewarded parties get paid their reward and the rewarded value is subtracted from the Reward balance. As an example, let’s assume that a block has 2…"
