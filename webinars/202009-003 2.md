Much has been written about the transformative potential of Blockchain and DLT: target use cases, expected outcomes, ways it will change the world, and so on. And in truth, DLT has the potential to change the world as much as the internet itself has, if not more.

The goal of this session will be to give listeners an intuitive understanding of why that transformative potential is so strong by establishing its linkage to the world's first and oldest business requirement - one we are still trying to solve.

The talk assumes a wikipedia-level understanding of blockchain and DLT, but no specific advance preparation is required.
