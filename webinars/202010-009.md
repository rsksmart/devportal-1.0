Now DAI is available on RSK!
By bringing the tools and assets that power decentralized finance to a Bitcoin environment, MakerDAO and RSK, together with the RIF token community, can fuel growing demand for DeFi assets and applications without being hampered by Ethereum's high fees.
DAI on RSK will bring the crypto-collateralized stablecoin to a scalable smart contract network while maintaining a connection with Ethereum and its valuable community of users and developers.
On this webinar you will learn about the technology behind the RSK-Ethereum Token Bridge and about those who made it possible.
