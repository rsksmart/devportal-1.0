Sovryn is a decentralized protocol for Bitcoin lending and margin trading. The protocol can be easily integrated into new and existing exchanges, or accessed simply through a web3 portal. Sovryn will provide decentralized alternatives of all the most popular centralised Bitcoin finance tools. 
Current Features:
ðŸŸ¢ Spot-Exchange - a low cost, low-slippage, AMM allowing instant trades between tokens.
âš« Margin Trading - Creates up to 5X long/short trades, allowing users to borrow leverage from the lending pool.
âšª Lending Pool - Allows HODLers to earn interest by lending tokens to margin traders and borrowers.
ðŸŸ¢ Smart BTC Relay - Allows use of Bitcoin almost instantly with smart contracts and decentralized products, from any Bitcoin wallet. 
What makes Sovryn unique is that it is decentralized, and uses Ethereum-like smart contracts but on the RSK Bitcoin sidechain.
