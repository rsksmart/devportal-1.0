NFTs have much more going for them than a lack of fungibility.
Non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable digital scarcity, as well as digital ownership, and the possibility of asset interoperability across multiple platforms. NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto art, crypto-collectibles and crypto-gaming.
At this webinar we will learn how versatile they are!
