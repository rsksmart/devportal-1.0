RSKSwap is a decentralized exchange that automatically exchanges ERC20 tokens: you don't longer need to wait for a buyer or seller!

It has the advantage of low costs and security of the RSK network.

It doesn’t require KYC and has no limits for withdrawals or deposits. 

In this webinar you will have a step-by-step guide to create your own token and exchange it in RSKSwap automatically, using Smart Contracts.
