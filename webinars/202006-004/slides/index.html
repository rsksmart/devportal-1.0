## Hands-on

[developers.rsk.co/tutorials/dweb/first-swarm-website](/tutorials/dweb/first-swarm-website/)

---NOTE

`Brendan`

Now we are about to start our hand-on section of today's webinar.

The article linked here is the materials that we will be following along today in today's demo,
so please open it up in a new browser tab as it will make it much easier to follow along.

Time to start up your fire up your terminals and code editors!

- Brendan: Installs Swarm, opens code editor and uploads website (with html and image).
- Brendan: Then kicks the ball to Rinke, shares hash.
- Rinke takes over screen and downloads website.
- Rinke views website on localhost.
- Rinke: Here comes a bit of theory, explaining what has been happening on the background (peer-to-peer).
- Rinke: Then edits the website and uploads it again. Gives hash to Brendan and Brendan takes over again :)
- Brendan: View Rinke's hash on localhost
- Brendan: View Rinke's hash on swarm gateway
- Brendan: Ask audience to share their hashes in the chat

---

## Your demos!

Share your `bzz:/` URLs in the chat!

---NOTE

`Rinke`

- Audience should have already seen us viewing each others Swarm hashes
- Ask audience to visit Brendan's Swarm hash and Rinke's Swarm hash themselves
- Encourage audience to share their own Swarm hashes
- Instructions on how to convert a localhost `bzz:/` URL to swarm gateway `bzz:/` URL
  - `http://localhost:8500/bzz:/1c97998044167e1d836e4290d60f812a7838d1c1551ebd86fd2b4bae2f9a44ee/`
  - `https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/1c97998044167e1d836e4290d60f812a7838d1c1551ebd86fd2b4bae2f9a44ee/`

## We're back!

Questions?

---NOTE

`Brendan`

That was the demo!

Did anyone have any questions before we wrap up?

---

## Pushing the boundaries

- DWeb technology is cutting edge

---NOTE

`Brendan`

So before we wrap up, I would just like to quickly mention,
that while Swarm is at the cutting edge of the decentralised web,
the DWeb, as a whole, is still very much in its infancy.

So watch this space!

(skip sub-slides)

---SUB

`Brendan`

- [Transforming links](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsksmart.github.io/blob/768be3be60f14eba780f1ac118694de8bf2aaa54/_plugins/custom_links.rb)

---NOTE

When you upload a website onto decentralised storage,
it's address is going to be a hash.
You cannot know ahead of time what the URL will be,
since it contains said hash.
(Unless you solely use the decentralised DNS, and do not use the hash at all.)

This means that while it is customary to use absolute links, that is those starting with a `/` in regular web development, this can break your site.
So I say to that, "¿por que no los dos?"
have your cake an eat it too.

The RSK dev portal is a static site built using Jekyll.
In preparation for uploading it to the DWeb on Swarm,
I have created a custom Jekyll plugin that
takes all such absolute links and transforms them to their relative forms, such that they will work without knowing the hash ahead of time.

---SUB

- [`bzz-web:/`](https://github.com/bguiz/bzz-web)

---NOTE

`Brendan`

The site that we created today works as an excellent example, under demo conditions, because it has relatively few files,
and their paths do not overlap in certain ways that trip up the way in which the actual filenames to be served are resolved, which we may be accustomed to, such as trailing `/`-es and auto-appending `index.html`.

As such, in order for this to work with a fairly complex website such as the RSK DevPortal, I created a simple proxy server to augment the standard `bzz:/` protocol server that ships with swarm.

## Where to go from here?

- Register a decentralised domain name for your website on Swarm
- Swarm Feeds and messaging
- Using the incentivized Swarm network

---NOTE

`Brendan`

What we have done today is not all there is for a decentralised web!
There are a number of other topics to cover,
and we will be sure to let you know when we run the next sessions on these topics
that we have up here on the screen now!
