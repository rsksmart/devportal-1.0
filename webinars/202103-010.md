rLogin allows web application developers to integrate blockchain technologies giving the user the power of data portability. After integrating rLogin you achieve:

- A back-end authenticating users by their wallet addressed - their Decentralized Identifiers.
- A registration model capable of requesting users for data stored in its user-centric cloud storage, the Data Vault.
- A front-end capable of interacting with any wallet that the user chooses, with a pre-designed user experience for registration and login.
- Compatibility with a unified platform where the user can control their identity and information, the RIF Identity Manager.
