Social inclusion is at the heart of IOV’s purpose as an organization. It is of foremost importance in the post-COVID era, to help marginalized communities by providing better access to fair markets and financial services thanks to reputational profiles based on social and economic contributions made by individuals.

IOV is sponsoring the socio-economic inclusion track of #PCH2020, where global teams are invited to create innovative solutions to tackle issues brought upon us by the pandemic, utilizing blockchain technologies. We look forward to the use cases developed as a result of the hackathon, which we expect will have a positive impact in the post-pandemic society as a whole.

In this event, we will cover the following:

- Improving access to fair markets
- Improving access to financial services
- How blockchain and other decentralised technologies can help
- The need for innovation in the post-COVID era
