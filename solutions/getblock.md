#### How to make a JSON-RPC request over HTTP

To send JSON RPC over HTTP, it is required to send the request using POST to URL `rsk.getblock.io` with the headers `Content-Type:application/json` and `x-api-key:your-api-key`, and also, the request body.

The example of receiving the number of the last block:

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0","id": "healthcheck","method": "eth_getBlockByNumber","params": ["latest", false]}
```

#### How to make a JSON-RPC request over CURL

[](#top "multiple-terminals")
- Linux, Mac OSX
  ```shell
curl -X POST 'rsk.getblock.io' \
--header 'x-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "healthcheck",
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": ["latest", false]
}'
  ```
- Windows
  ```windows-command-prompt
curl -X POST 'rsk.getblock.io' \
--header 'x-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "healthcheck",
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": ["latest", false]
}'
  ```

#### How to make a JSON-RPC request using Postman

#### Websockets

To send JSON RPC over Websocket, it is required to establish the connection:

[](#top "multiple-terminals")
- Linux, Mac OSX
  ```shell
wscat -c https://rsk.getblock.io/websocket -H "x-api-key:<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  ```
- Windows
  ```windows-command-prompt
wscat -c https://rsk.getblock.io/websocket -H "x-api-key:<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  ```

Then, send the request body:

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0","id": "healthcheck","method": "eth_getBlockByNumber","params": ["latest", false]}
```

**Result**

```
wscat -c https://rsk.getblock.io/websocket -H "x-api-key:<YOUR-API-KEY>"

Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
> {"jsonrpc": "2.0","id": "healthcheck","method": "eth_getBlockByNumber","params": ["latest", false]}
< {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"healthcheck","result":{"number":"0x2f4d6d","hash":"0x7cec4e01768b4e009fa78d625024ec81dab7811dc2e497f6d831fb051f41c236","parentHash":"0xf0af3726672c218c33e81de33e5f69bb008555931bd63056d24bde6a2cbfca87"..........
