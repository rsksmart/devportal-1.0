In this section, we will cover the difference between a stablecoin and other digital assets like bitcoins, fiat currency, fungible tokens, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDCs), and Altcoins.

## Stablecoin vs Bitcoins

A stablecoin is a token that has a non-volatile price and Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency whose price is volatile in nature. Stablecoins are used  to minimize the price volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins.

## Stablecoin vs Altcoin

Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Similar comparisons apply, with regards to volatility.

## Stablecoin vs Fiat

Stablecoins are issued by crypto companies that are backed by traditional financial investment tools. They can be pegged to any fiat currency, foreign exchange-traded commodities, precious or industrial metals.

While fiat currencies are issued by central banks, they are not asset-backed. Their value depends on the central bank. The central bank can regulate the total supply in circulation by printing and withdrawing them from use.

## Stablecoin vs Fungible Tokens

A stablecoin is a type of fungible token whose value is fixed to another asset, often currencies such as the US dollar or the Euro, and other assets.

## Stablecoin vs CBDCs

A stablecoin may or may not be regulated, while Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is completely regulated by the monetary authorities of a nation. This means stablecoins are decentralized while CBDCs are centralized. Furthermore, CBDCs may be implemented with fungible tokens, in a manner similar to stablecoins, or they may be implemented using other technologies, including centralised ones.

## Stablecoin Gas fee Comparison tool 

This is a tool for comparing average gas fees paid for the last 200 transfer transactions of DAI and USDT Stablecoins on Ethereum and RSK blockchains. The tool makes a live request to the Covalent database, gets the information about the latest transactions of selected Stablecoin and displays the prices converted to USD using the latest rBTC - USD and Ether - USD exchange rate.
