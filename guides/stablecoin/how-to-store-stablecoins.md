Stablecoins can be stored using crypto-wallets. 

Some crypto wallets support smart contracts when they connect to blockchain networks such as RSK. They allow a user to invoke smart contract functions. Recall one of the differences between tokens and cryptocurrency, which is that tokens are implemented using smart contracts. Thus crypto wallets which understand smart contracts are necessary to store and transfer tokens.

Crypto wallets can come in various forms, including hardware wallets, and software wallets. Read more about [Hardware and Software Wallets](https://developers.rsk.co/kb/get-crypto-on-rsk/rbtc-wallets/#hardware-and-software-wallets) to learn about the difference between these types of wallets.

Also, watch this explainer video below to understand how crypto wallets work:

### Using Software Wallets

You can add any of these stablecoins to a wallet integrated with the RSK network that lets you add custom tokens. This includes [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Nifty](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet), or any wallet that supports [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/).

The following wallets can also be used to store stablecoins, as these wallets both support RSK and the ERC20 Token Standard.
