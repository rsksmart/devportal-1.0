**TEX**

[TEX](https://tex.moneyonchain.com/) is a decentralized token exchange by Money On Chain.

What makes TEX special is that the mechanism used for trading is inspired by the method used at The London Gold Fix.  With this method, periodic ticks in an order book match operations at an emerging price, avoiding front-running and allowing fair price discovery even with low volume.

With TEX, you can access RDOC, DOC and other tokens on the RSK network.
