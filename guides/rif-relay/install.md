## Requirements

### RSK Node

You need to have a running RSK node version [IRIS-3.2.0](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/releases) or higher.

### Yarn

We use `yarn` version `v1.22.0` for package management. 

Installation instructions at Yarn's [site](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). Check the install by running `yarn version`.

### Node & NPM

We use `Node` version `v12.18.3`. 

We recommend the use of [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and the `.nvmrc` file included at the root of this project, so you can install the correct node version through:

```
nvm use
nvm install
```

If you choose to use node without `nvm`, you can find installation instructions at Node's [site](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

You can check the installation by running `node -v`.

### Npx & Truffle

An important tool we use for interacting with the blockchain is `Truffle` version `v5.0.33`.

You can follow the installation guide in the official [site](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle).

We run all truffle commands with the prefix `npx`. This is to execute node packages using the project's version.

Checking the install by running `npx truffle version`.

The configuration file is `truffle.js`. Please see Truffle's documentation for details about this file and how to use it.

### Docker

We recommend following the official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for installing Docker and keeping it updated.

You'll need to install both `docker` as well as `docker-compose`.

#### Running on macOS
To run the project using Docker on a Mac, please follow these steps or the scripts and web apps will not work. 

- Patch `readlink`
The startup scripts assume that GNU's `readlink` command is available. But MacOS ships with BSD's `readlink`, which is incompatible with GNU's version. So we must patch `readlink`. This can be done using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as follows:

```
brew install coreutils
ln -s /usr/local/bin/greadlink /usr/local/bin/readlink
```

After this step, you must make sure that your `PATH` variable gives priority to `/usr/local/bin` over `/usr/bin`. You can check this with `which readlink`, which should output `/usr/local/bin/readlink`. Alternatively try executing `readlink -f .`, if it works you're ok.

## Building the project

Clone the project. Then run the following from the project's 
root directory to build it.

```
yarn install
yarn prepare
```

## Deploy contracts Locally

We'll use `truffle` for deploying contracts. Have an RSK node up and running in regtest mode and then execute the following on the project's root folder:

`npx truffle migrate --network rsk`


After running this command you will see a summary of contracts on the 
terminal, something similar to this:

```
|===================================|============================================|
| Contract                          | Address                                    |

```

You'll need to save this summary for later use.

## Deploy contracts On Testnet

We'll use `truffle` for deploying contracts.

```
npx truffle migrate --network rsktestnet
``` 
> Disclaimer: to use testnet, you should have an unlocked account with funds or configure it in `truffle.js`.

These contracts have been deployed on Testnet. See [here](/rif/relay/contracts/) for their addresses.
