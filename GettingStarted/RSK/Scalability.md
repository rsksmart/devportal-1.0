## Scalability

RSK can scale far beyond Bitcoin in its current state. An RSK payment requires a fifth of the size of a standard Bitcoin payment. Using the proposed LTCP protocol, transaction size can be reduced to 1/50th of a Bitcoin transaction size. This immediately leads to a substantial increase in transaction volume capability. Besides, there are community proposals (RSKIPs) to enable user-selectable signature schemes: ECDSA, Schnorr and Ed25519. Because Ed25519 is more performant than Bitcoin ECDSA curve, using this scheme may lead to even more capacity.
