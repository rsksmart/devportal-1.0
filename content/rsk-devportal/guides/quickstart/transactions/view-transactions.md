When you performed each of the transactions, you should have received notifications in popups.

However, if you missed this, not to worry, you can also find this within the transaction history within MetaMask. To do so, within the main screen of MetaMask, click on the “Activity” tab. You’ll see the list of the transactions.

Then you click on any transaction, and click on the arrow button beside copy button named transaction ID, this takes you to the [Testnet explorer](https://explorer.testnet.co)

If you clicked on the popup notification, or if you find it within the “Activity” tab, either way, this should open up the block explorer with the selected transaction selected.

For the transaction of the tRBTC transfer, you should see this

You will notice that this transaction has an amount.

For the transaction of the tRIF transfer, you should see this

You will notice that this transaction has a zero amount, but it does emit some events, which is because the smart contract of the RIF token does this.
