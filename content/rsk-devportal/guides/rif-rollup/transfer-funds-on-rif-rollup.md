In this tutorial, we’ll review how to transfer funds to another RIF Rollup account. Whether a Rootstock user has a RIF Rollup account or not, you can send them funds on RIF Rollup to the same address they have on Rootstock.

> Keep in mind these funds will be on Layer 2 (L2), so if you want to use these funds on Layer 1 (L1), you will need to [Send to Rootstock](withdraw-funds-rootstock).

1. Click on the token of choice
In this tutorial, we use RBTC, click on token.
