> **Note:** We will be using the 2 way peg app on [2-Way Peg App - Testnet](https://app.2wp.testnet.rootstock.io/) for learning purposes.
> For transactions using **real tokens**, use the [2-Way Peg App - Mainnet](https://app.2wp.rootstock.io/) application.

### Install Apps

The Bitcoin testnet app does not show on Ledger live manager by default. To be able to see the BTC Testnet app you need to enable the developer mode in Ledger live.

[](#top "collapsible")
- Enable Developer Mode for Bitcoin Testnet
    1. Connect your ledger hardware device and unlock it.
    2. Open Ledger live, click on Manager and open settings. 
    3. Navigate to the experimental features menu and enable developer mode. This will show developer and testnet apps in the manager.
         <div align="left"><img width="70%" src="/assets/img/guides/two-way-peg-app/install-apps-settings.png" alt="Install Apps Settings"/></div>
    4. Go to Ledger live manager and search for Bitcoin testnet app
    5. Click on install to install the Bitcoin Testnet application. To use the testnet app you also need the main Bitcoin app. So install both the apps to your device.
        <div align="left"><img width="70%" src="/assets/img/guides/two-way-peg-app/install-bitcoin-test.png" alt="Install bitcoin test"/></div>
- Get Testnet address
    - On your ledger device, you’ll find all the apps installed on your device. The Bitcoin app to be used on Mainnet, and Bitcoin Test app to be used on Testnet. To start using testnet, we need the testnet address, to get this address:
        1. Open the Bitcoin test app on your ledger device. You will see a “Bitcoin Testnet is ready” screen
        2. In the ledger live app, go to accounts tab, click on add account.
            <div align="left"><img width="70%" src="/assets/img/guides/two-way-peg-app/add-account.png" alt="Add Account"/></div>
        3. Search testnet and select Bitcoin Testnet (BTC). Click on Continue
            <div align="left"><img width="70%" src="/assets/img/guides/two-way-peg-app/add-accounts.png" alt="Add Account 2"/></div>
        4. Approve the Bitcoin Test app on your hardware wallet device
        5. On the next screen choose the address format (Native SegWit / SegWit).
        6. Click on **Add Account**:
            <div align="left"><img width="70%" src="/assets/img/guides/two-way-peg-app/add-account-3.png" alt="Add Accounts 3"/></div>
        > Note: See [supported addresses](/guides/two-way-peg-app/advanced-operations/supported-wallets/) for the types of addresses supported by the 2 way peg app.
        - You have successfully added the Bitcoin testnet app to your account.

    4. Use the following faucet to receive testnet tokens:
        - Open [Coinfaucet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/)
        - Paste the address into the field and click on Get Bitcoins. 
    > _Note: You need at least **0.005 BTC** to perform a peg-in on Mainnet and Testnet. Likewise, you need at least **0.004 RBTC** to perform a peg-out on Mainnet and Testnet._
- Get Mainnet Tokens
    - You can get BTC on Exchanges like [Liquality](/solutions/liquality/) and [Defiant](https://www.defiantapp.tech/en/en). For details on how to get RBTC, see [Get Crypto on Rootstock](/guides/get-crypto-on-rsk/).
    > The 2 way peg app is available on both Mainnet and Testnet. Both applications follow the same process, for production purposes, use [Mainnet](https://app.2wp.rootstock.io/), for testing and development purposes, use the [Testnet](https://app.2wp.testnet.rootstock.io/). 
    > See [glossary](/guides/two-way-peg-app/glossary/) for explanation of these terms.
