## About 3xpl

While many explorers typically support only a few blockchains or are limited to a single architecture, 3xpl aims to support as many blockchains as possible within a single interface and data format. This helps users to locate their addresses and transactions across different blockchains without switching contexts. The universal search bar allows you to search all blockchains at once.

A significant feature of 3xpl is its open-source core, which assures that the data it presents can be independently verified by running 3xpl's code. This transparency fosters trust and encourages community contributions, enabling quicker growth and more efficient development.

## Privacy First

Block explorers and their advertising partners tend to track users to maximize their profits. When an ad network or Google Analytics is used, explorers leak which users see which transactions, thus making it possible to connect users with their transactions and wallet balances.
3xpl takes privacy seriously and has no 3rd party code on its pages. 3xpl offers an Onion hidden service on the Tor network for maximum privacy. 3xpl can work without JavaScript being enabled.
