### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

RootstockLabs aims to meet the following SLAs for hackers participating in our program:

* Time to first response (from report submit) - 5 business days
* Time to triage (from report submit) - 7 business days
* Time to bounty (from triage) - 15 business days

We aim to keep you informed about the progress throughout the process.

### Disclosure Policy

* Follow HackerOne's [disclosure guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines).
* Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty. If the user reports the vulnerability to other security teams (e.g. Ethereum or ETC) but reports to RootstockLabs with considerable delay, then RootstockLabs may reduce or cancel the bounty.

### Scope and Rules

Visit the [Scope Section on Hackerone](https://hackerone.com/rootstocklabs/policy_scopes) to view the scope / out of scope vulnerability, and the program rules.
