To use Blockscout with Rootstock, you must visit the [Rootstock Block Explorer](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/), where you can see the latest blocks, transactions, and addresses on the Rootstock network.

### Search for specific information
You can look up a specific transaction by entering the wallet address, transaction hash block number, or token in the search bar at the top pane of the Rootstock Blockscout page.

### Overviews
The grids below the search bar show an overview of various components on the Rootstock platform. You can see the total blocks on the network and the total transactions. You can click the respective grid to view the block list or transactions. Likewise, the grids present other details like the average block time, number of wallet addresses, current gas, and total BTC locked in the Rootstock 2-way peg.

### Blockscout API
Blockscout allows you to programmatically query various details from the Rootstock network via the API. You can access the Blockscout API by clicking on the "API" button at the bottom of the page, where you can find documentation and examples of using the API for various purposes.

Here's a basic example of how to use Blockscout with Rootstock in Python to get the latest block number:
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://rootstock.blockscout.com/api?module=block&action=eth_block_number")
latest_block = int(response.json()['result'], 16)  # Converts hex to integer
print(f"Latest Rootstock Block Number: {latest_block}")
```
This Python script uses the Blockscout API to fetch the latest block number on the Rootstock mainnet. 
**Response:**
```bash
Latest Rootstock Block Number: 6019497
```
You must have Python and the `requests` library installed to run this script.

### Verify and publish smart contracts on Rootstock
You can verify and publish a smart contract on the Rootstock network by clicking **other>>Verify Contract** from the left menu. Then, you supply the contract address and your preferred verification method from the supported contract verification methods list.
