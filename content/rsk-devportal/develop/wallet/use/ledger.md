At this point you might be notified that the Ledger Nano S firmware is outdated. If it is, we suggest you proceed with the update procedure before continuing. We highly recommend you check to have the backup of the security seed at hand before upgrading the firmware or installing any applications on the device.

Before installing the RSK app, you must install the Ethereum app. If you already have it installed, you may be asked to have Ethereum’s app latest version. If that is the case, please delete already installed Ethereum app at this point.
